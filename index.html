            <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin,
                or
                depriving
                yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your
                health, and boosting your mood.Proper foods are foods that aren’t just empty calories, foods that
                actually give you proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. <span class="words-color">
                    “proper food” means, food with a nutritional value that you can eat to get proteins, vitamins, and
                    minerals.</span> If the food you’re eating
                doesn’t give you any of those things, then it’s not proper food, and you probably shouldn’t be eating
                it.</p>
